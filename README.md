## Deploy to GitHub Pages project site

[View documentation on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#project-pages)

For this project, we can simply push our repo to the `gh-pages` branch since it has the `index.html` in the root.

`git push origin master:gh-pages`

This command pushes the local `master` branch to the remote `gh-pages` branch.
